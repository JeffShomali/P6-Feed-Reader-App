# Test Driven JavaScript App With Jasmine

This is tiny testing project using Jasmine 2.1.2 library. If you don't know what is Jasmine read this article [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_(JavaScript_testing_framework)
> **Jasmine** is an open source testing framework for JavaScript.[2] It aims to run on any JavaScript-enabled platform, to not intrude on the application nor the IDE, and to have easy-to-read syntax. It is heavily influenced by other unit testing frameworks, such as ScrewUnit, JSSpec, JSpec, and RSpec.[3]
